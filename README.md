### Configuration changes made
Configuration changes are outlined [here](https://github.com/bcko/Linux-Server-Configuration-Udacity-Fullstack). I pretty much followed this guideline. Most issues that I had during setup were due to my code being written for a virtual local machine. I had to update the client_secret.json, the postgresql uri, and the path to the client_secret.json file.
